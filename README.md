# **Meeting 09/20/23**

Time: 09/20/23 at 6:00 PM (CT)  
Place: Virtual (Via Microsoft Teams)  
Attendance: Josh, Jennifer, Mark, Jawad  
Purpose: Establish Team Roles, Add all members to GitHub Page, Work on Management Plan  
  
Sam was unable to attend because of a prior engagement. Basim did not attend.  
Jennifer and Jawad could not meet in person, so the meeting took place on Microsoft Teams.

Since Sam created the GitHub Repo, no one was able to be added during the meeting. However, Josh posted a Microsoft Teams conversation to collect the GitHub usernames/email addresses of the members to be added later.  
Team roles were then created and assigned.  
Roles:
  
Project Leader: Sam  
Configuration Management Engineer: Jennifer  
Requirements Engineer: Jawad  
Quality Assurance Engineer: Mark  
Implementation Director: TBD  
Design Director: TBD  

Josh did not choose a role so that Basim could decide between the remaining roles. Each role was created so that all members could participate in all stages of the development process while getting a share of leadership responsibility.
Two vision statements were brainstormed for the project: "To make all students' lives easier" and "To evaluate complex arithmetic expressions."
Josh also created a Word Document to collect the profiles of each team member, including their availability and expertise. Profiles for Josh, Jennifer, and Mark were completed during the meeting.
Basic planning was discussed in regard to the completion of the Project Management Plan. While all parties will contribute to its completion, Josh and Sam will focus on completing the remaining sections of the plan. The Configuration Management Engineer will ensure that the plan is formatted uniformly and will add it to the GitHub repo.  

We updated our profile document to include availabilities:

# **Meeting 09/27/2023**

Time: 09/27/23 at 6:00 PM (CT)  
Place: Virtual (Via Microsoft Teams)  
Attendance: Josh, Jennifer, Mark, Basim, Sam

Purpose: Work on extra credit question, decide next steps.  
We decided as a team to postpone working on the software requirements specification since the requirements engineer was unable to attend. Instead, we collaborated on the extra credit question.  
  
Sam and Josh are going to look through the requirements documents (section 1 and 2) and get started on the basics, but are going to wait until our next meeting where everyone is in attendance to make significant updates.

# **Meeting 10/04/2023**

Time: 10/04/23 at 6:00 PM (CT)  
Place: Virtual (Via Microsoft Teams) and in-person  
Attendance: Josh, Jennifer, Mark, Sam, Jawad  
Purpose: Work on requirements document, specifically section 3.  
  
We decided to focus on functional requirements, which are outlined in the project description. Specifically, this project should contain +, -, *, /, %, and ^, with ** being added as possible desired functionality. For now, our project is going to use integers only, but changing the functionality to support doubles is a possibility in the future. We need to include order of operations as well as handling of parentheses. Support for expressions contained in brackets is a desired functionality. Error handling for 0 division, extraneous parentheses, invalid characters or numbers, and invalid expressions will be included. Unmatched parentheses would be ignored. For other possible functionality we could include, we listed: expressions in the (a + b)^exp format, factorial expressions, fractional exponents, user-defined variables, and sin and cos functions. We decided on a command-line interface for input.

We also worked on the use case diagram. Those team members who attended the meeting in-person drew the diagram on whiteboard. We decided to use a generalized use-case for error handling, with a specific use case for each error. We also used a generalized case for input, and a specific case for each operator.

We also discussed constraints and non-functional requirements. For constraints, we will be developing this program in C++, per the project description, using common c++ data structures, such as the stack.

For non-functional requirements, this product should be compatible with all mainstream operating systems.

Our deliverables for the meeting next week include completion of the Functionality section of the requirements document, and addition of the use-case diagram.
